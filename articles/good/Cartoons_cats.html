It is restricted solely to notable feline characters from notable animated <i>television shows</i>. For characters that appear in several separate television series, only the earliest series will be recorded here. </p><table class="wikitable sortable jquery-tablesorter"><tbody><tr><th>Character </th><th>Origin </th><th>Notes </th></tr><tr><td>Arlene </td><td><i>Garfield</i></td><td>She is pink, skinny, elegant and has a gap between her two front teeth which Garfield often makes fun of. In Garfield Gets Real, she seems to love Garfield more than anyone, but Garfield didn't seem to notice. Garfield once quipped in the early strips that he and Arlene have an apparent love-hate relationship: Garfield loves himself, and Arlene hates that. At least once Garfield annoyed Arlene so much when he fell asleep on their date that she beat him up. She is the equivalent of Liz who has a similar no start relationship with Jon Arbuckle. </td></tr><tr><td>Artemis </td><td><i>Codename: Sailor V</i></td><td>He is the companion to the leader of the Guardian Senshi—he trained Minako Aino as Sailor V, and remains by her side when she takes on her proper role as Sailor Venus in <i>Sailor Moon</i>. </td></tr><tr><td>Azrael </td><td>Smurfs &amp; The Smurfs Christmas Special </td><td>Comic relief sidekick to Gargamel; always tries but never catches the Smurfs. Replaced as sidekick by Gargarmel nephew "Scruple". </td></tr><tr><td>Babbit and Catstello </td><td>Merrie Melodies<sup>[1]</sup></td><td><i>Babbit and Catstello</i> are Looney Tunes based on the comedic duo Abbott and Costello. Although the short, fat character calls the other one "Babbit", the tall, skinny one never addresses his partner by name; the name "Catstello" was invented later. In their first three cartoons, the "Babbit" character was voiced by Tedd Pierce, and Mel Blanc performed "Catstello". Later, Babbit is voiced by Corey Burton and Frank Welker performs Catstello. </td></tr><tr><td>Banjo </td><td><i>Banjo the Woodpile Cat</i></td><td>An overly curious and rebellious kitten who, after getting into trouble for falling from a house to see if he could land on his feet, runs away from his woodpile home in his owners' farm. </td></tr><tr><td>Beans </td><td>Merrie Melodies </td><td>Early colleague of Porky Pig and sometimes Ham and Ex's uncle.<sup>[2]</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Beerus </td><td>Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods </td><td>Purple cat based loosely on Egyptian mythology. He is the god of destruction. </td></tr><tr><td>Beverely </td><td>Where's Huddles? </td><td>Spoiled cat of Claude Pertwee. </td></tr><tr><td>Boo </td><td>Funky Phantom </td><td>Ghost cat sidekick of Funky Phantom who teased Elmo the dog. </td></tr><tr><td>Branya </td><td><i>The Comic Artist and Assistants</i></td><td>An adorable little orange kitty who embodies the manga's mascot.

She and Wendy belonged to Cait Shelter before joining Fairy Tail. Carla is a small, white Exceed with pink ears and brown eyes, which are smaller than Happy's eyes. She also has two whiskers on each side of her face. Carla wears a pink bow near the end of her tail. Unlike the carefree Happy, Carla is very strict and serious most of the time, rarely showing emotions. </td></tr><tr><td>Chloe </td><td>The secret life of pets 2 </td><td></td></tr><tr><td>The Catillac Cats </td><td><i>Heathcliff</i></td><td>A group of cats who live in a junkyard and headed by Riff-Raff, an orange short, tough, streetwise alley cat whose main residence is one-half of an old transport overlooking the yard. Besides Riff-Raff, supporting characters include Cleo cat {Riff-Raff girlfriend}; Hector a streetwise Hispainc cat; Wordsworth W. Wordsworth a hip-hop groovy cat who speaks in rhyme; Mungo a big black Persian cat; and Spike the junkyard dog. </td></tr><tr><td>Catbus </td><td><i>My Neighbor Totoro</i></td><td>It is a large creature, depicted as a grinning male[1] cat with a hollow body that serves as a bus, complete with windows and seats coated with fur, and a large bushy tail. The character's popularity has led to its use in a spinoff film, toys for children, an art car, and being featured in the Ghibli Museum, among other products and influences. </td></tr><tr><td>Cat </td><td><i>CatDog</i></td><td>Somewhat uptight and believes strongly in being polite and neat. He is a stickler for cleanliness and, like most cats, is aquaphobic. He is also obsessed with jet skis, once stating that he would sell his soul for one. Cat is 26 years old. Despite his sophisticated personality, Cat also has a dark side. Whenever he snaps, Cat becomes a ruthless, psychopathic maniac who even the Greasers are scared of once they see what he is capable of doing. He is attached to his twin brother, Dog. </td></tr><tr><td>Cat </td><td><i>Peg + Cat</i></td><td>A blue cat whose best friend is Peg. He loves circles and accompanies Peg on her adventures. Cat often inspires Peg to realize a solution to a problem without being aware of it himself. </td></tr><tr><td>Chance (T-Bone) </td><td><i>SWAT Kats</i></td><td>The larger member of the SWAT Kats and pilot of the Turbokat jet.

His name comes from his chocolate-colored nose.<sup>[3][4]</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Claude Cat </td><td><i>Looney Tunes</i></td><td>(a pun on the homophone "clawed cat") had his origins in several other cat characters used by Chuck Jones from 1940 to 1945.

She's a cartoon character. She is a little girl. She is a friend. But she is not a cat. She's never depicted on all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature. She does have a pet cat of her own, however, and it's called Charmmy Kitty. She is a cat.<sup>[5]</sup></p></div></div> </div><div class=page-footer><div class="wds-collapsible-panel wds-is-collapsed page-footer__categories"><header aria-controls=collapsible-content-categories aria-expanded=false class=wds-collapsible-panel__header> Categories <svg class="wds-icon wds-icon-small"><use xlink:href=#wds-icons-menu-control-small></use></svg> </header><div class=wds-collapsible-panel__content id=collapsible-content-categories><nav class="article-categories CategorySelect articlePage" id=articleCategories><div class=container><ul class=categories><li class=special-categories-label><a class=categoriesLink href=/wiki/Special:Categories title=Special:Categories>Categories</a><span>: </span></li><li class="category normal" data-name=Cartoon data-namespace data-outertag data-sortkey data-type=normal><span class=name><a class=newcategory href=/wiki/Category:Cartoon title=Category:Cartoon>Cartoon</a></span><span class="tool removeCategory"></span></li></ul></div></nav></div></div><div class=license-description> Community content is available under <a href=https://www.fandom.com/licensing>CC-BY-SA</a> unless otherwise noted. </div><div id=mw-data-after-content><div id=articleComments></div></div></div></main>
